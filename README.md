# ieexmml's competitive programming repository

I put some of my competitive programming code here

my_cp_framework.cpp is a collection of implementations of common cs problems that are common on programming contests. 
I get my problems from the book "Competitive programming 3" by Steven and Felix Halim.

# Why is everything in one file?
Most online judges used for competitive programming don't allow uploading header files. One file is the limit. This is ugly but I do try to make it better with code folding. Only works on Code::Blocks and (I haven't tested this tho) other IDEs that use Scintilla.
