# ieexmml's competitive programming repository

I put some of my competitive programming code here

my_cp_framework.cpp is a collection of implementations of algorithms and data structures that are common on programming contests. 
I get my problems from the book "Competitive programming 3" by Steven and Felix Halim. Get it [here](https://cpbook.net/).

### Why is everything in one file?
Most online judges used for competitive programming don't allow uploading header files. One file is the limit. This is ugly but I do try to make it better with code folding. Only works on Code::Blocks and (I haven't tested this tho) other IDEs that use Scintilla. 

### Why did I feel the need to write this readme if noone but me is ever gonna see this?
I like my contributions like I like my GPUs. Green and useless.
(Ok, i'll kms)
